# 1. Generated camera positions
#   => How to make the robotis arm understand the positions of the generated camera viewpoints (on a sphere) relative to the robot's frame of reference?

# 2. Use the intrinsic parameters of the microscope in NeRF Training
#   => Calibrate the camera (Learn how to calibrate microscope)
#   => Save the intrinsics (the intrinsics in calibration file is for the endoscope)
#   => Use intrinsics in NeRF Training

# 3. Move the arm to each camera position
# 4. Capture and save images
# 5. Train NeRF
